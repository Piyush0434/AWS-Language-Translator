````

### ☁️ Backend (AWS Lambda with Java)

1. Navigate to `TranslationBot`
2. Use **Maven** or **IntelliJ** to build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. Deploy the `.jar` to AWS Lambda:

   * Set handler in Lambda to: `com.example.lambdafunction.YourHandlerClass::handleRequest`
   * Ensure `AmazonTranslateFullAccess` permissions are set

## 🛠️ API Integration

The frontend sends requests to an AWS Lambda endpoint (exposed via API Gateway) which:

* Receives input JSON
* Translates text using `AmazonTranslate`
* Returns the translated response
